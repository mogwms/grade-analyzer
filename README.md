# Project Reflection
Programming Project 1

1. Algorithm Design: Describe how you approached designing the algorithm before coding. Your algorithm design must follow the process.

I created my algorithm to print the student's assignment grade, quiz grade, mid exam grade, and final grade. I started by prompting the user to input each grade, and then checking if the grade is a valid number. Then, I multiply each of the grades by their respective grade weight percentage and then add all of them together to get the final weighted grade. I then output the final weighted grade.

2. Testing: How did you test your program to ensure accuracy? Did you try edge cases (e.g., scores of 0 or 100)?

I tested my program using different scores, such as scores of 0, -1, and 100. My program would not accept scores that were less than 0 because they are invalid grades. I also tried doubles, like 88.54 or 73.25, which would be in normal grades.
